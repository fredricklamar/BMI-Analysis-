Let's assume this is a medical data saved by an online pharmacy on their website. 

Here are somethings to aim.

1. First prepare the data.. It will take you some time
2. Exploratory Data analysis.
3. Find the similarities and differences of the patients' gender based on their BMI. Test for the assumptions and use the right statistical tool.
4. Find if there is a statistical difference between the gender and the patients' blood type.
5. Find if there is a relationship between the patient's body weight and height.
6. Show some charts to further clarify your work.

PS: Use jupyter notebook if possible and use markdowns to explain every process. This work might take you more than a week, so take your time. 

Good luck, man.
